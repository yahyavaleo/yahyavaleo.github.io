# Personal Website

This is my personal website that I wrote to showcase my work.

## Structure

This is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. All the styles are located in the `css/` directory and all the JavaScript code is located in the `js/` directory. The assets folder contains the fonts, icons, and images used on this website.

All favicons and the associated `manifest.json` is located in the root directory. Otherwise the browser tries to search for the favicon in the same directory while loading the document, fails to do so, and encounters an _Error 404_ before finally loading the document and requesting the favicon in the correct location.
